# TU_WIEN_BETRIEBSSYSTEME

The solutions for the UE Betriebssysteme. If you do not find your assignment in the folder you expect it to find, search the other folders as well. I know that they changed the order in which they numbered the exercises, for example, at the moment I write this I know that they swapped assignment 1b with assignment 3.

## untested changes

Most of those programs were not tested on their test-server so I cannot guarantee that all of them compile warning free. But most likely they will.
