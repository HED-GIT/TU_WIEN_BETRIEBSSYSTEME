if you run this program on the ubuntu console for windows nanosleep may not work.

but it works on my normal ubuntu and my arch installation so i assume it is a problem with the windows ubuntu console and that it will work on their server, i can't really test that so if you can test it and this message is bothering you you can test it and open an issue to tell me if it works or not
